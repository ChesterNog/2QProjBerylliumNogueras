	<li>It was first aired on Nickolodeon on January 11, 2007 as a short animation, however the official show aired starting April 5, 2021 and ended on September 3, 2018.</li>
	<br>
    <li>I very rarely get to watch it, mostly on Friday nights as it replays at around 11pm to 12am.</li>
	<br>
    <li>The show is about 12-year-old Finn, who was found in the woods as a babyby Jake's parent's, Joshua and Margret, and his best friend and adopted brother Jake, a dog with magical powers, are adventurers living in the Land of Ooo, a setting full of surreal characters, with fantasy and post-apocalyptic elements.</li>
	<br>
    <li>When I was in kindergarten, I came across the show by accident and became interested immediately, so I started watching it more than I watch Shawn the Sheep, a disney cartoon.</li>
	<br>
    <li>I used to watch it as each episode was full of action, friendship and some satirical elements however I never got to watching the episodes closer to the end, like Distant Lands.</li>
