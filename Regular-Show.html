	<ul>
	<li>The first episode aired on August 14, 2009 and ended on January 16, 2017.</li>
	<br>
    <li>Like Adventure Time, I rarely manage to watch it as it replays before Adventure Time at around 10 to 11pm.</li>
	<br>
	<li>The show is about 2 best friends Mordecai and Rigby working as groundskeepers at a park trying to perfect useless skills and other things to keep themselves entertained.</li>
	<br>
    <li>When the an episode of the show starts, there is normally a calm, relaxed vibe given by their actions and conversations, however later in the episodes the action starts to escalate very quickly, leading to an intense battle every episode.</li>
	<br>
    <li>I see many things in the show, one being that it is extremely similar to The Amazing World of Gumball, in terms of jokes, actions and artstyle while being unique and genuine.</li>
